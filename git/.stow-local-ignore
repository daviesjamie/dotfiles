# GNU Stow uses a .stow-local-ignore file to override which files it should
# ignore when generating symlinks.
#
# By having this empty file here, it means that the default behaviour of
# ignoring a .gitignore file will not apply - meaning that the .gitignore
# in this directory can be installed correctly.
#
# For more information, see:
